### 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TarlanaVikas19/Image-Recognition.git
   cd Image-Recognition
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   *(Add `requirements.txt` once finalized)*

3. **Configure Kaggle API**
   - Place your `kaggle.json` file in the root directory
   - Run:
     ```bash
     mkdir ~/.kaggle
     cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
     chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
     ```

4. **Launch the notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Image_Recognition.ipynb
   ```
